		<h3 id="installation"><strong>A) Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Once you have your zip file from Envato you only need to upload it through the administration area in your WordPress website. <strong>Click on Dashboard > Plugins > Add New</strong>.</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/add-new-plugin.png" alt="installation-1" />
		
		<p>In the <strong>Add Plugins</strong> page you only have to click on the "Upload Plugin" button and select the file containing your new plugin. </p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/upload-plugin.png" alt="installation-2" />

		<p>Once you click the <strong>Install now</strong> button WordPress will take care of the process and show you a new page similar to this one</p>

		:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Deactivate</strong>: You can deactivate or activate Almond Easy Affiliate clicking here.</li>
			<li><strong>Edit</strong>: This link will redirect you to the source code of the plugin. I do not recommended to change anything from the source code if you do not fully understand what are you doing. In any case I'm available for customizations, just <a href="mailto:gabriel@almondwp.com">contact me</a> if you need to customize Almond Easy Affiliate to fit your needs.</li>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Text to display</strong>: The title you'd like to show in the front of your website in the top of the widget, if any.</li>
			<li><strong>Affiliate link</strong>: a ticker is the one to four letter code that represents a particular stock or company in the stock market, writing the ticker of any company available will return the actual price and volume about the company.</li>

			<li><strong>Add Image</strong>: For adding a new image, once clicked the button, new fields and buttons will appear, you must fill the field with the local URL and save it into the database, the plugin will create a new shortcode for you so the affiliate image can easily added through the content on your site.</li>
			<li><strong>Refresh</strong>: Updates the latest information from the database.</li>
			<span>Saving a link in the database will create an affiliate shortcode that can be copied and pasted anywhere in WordPress, that will generate the link through your content.</span>

		<h3 id="faq"><strong>C) Frequent Asked Questions</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Why cannot I add manually or change the ID number associated to each affiliate?</p>
		<p>We decided to avoid that the user can do that for a simple reason, so the user don't have to keep track of outdated affiliates, each affiliate have an unique ID that will show the unique affiliate link or do not show anything in case that doesn't exist in the database. This way the user is sure that there is no outdated or wrong affiliate links through the website and edit them one by one.</p>
